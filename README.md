# ImageSegmentation
Component Segmentation of Aerial Views using Neural Networks

The component segmentation of images provides a way to easily recognize various regions of interest (ROIs) as huge volumes of optical overhead imagery are captured every day with airborne or space-borne platforms making it impossible for manual inter- pretation. In the aerial views of cities and landscapes, this can be used to distinguish objects like roads, buildings, and so on [1, 2, 3]. This task can be applied for map making, object detection, and geographical monitoring. It is also very helpful in ecological tasks such as monitoring deforestation or damage in an area impacted by natural disaster[4]. The focus of the project will be successful road detection given aerial images of cities, further for buildings, with the conviction that the process can be applied to some of the aforementioned tasks with further research and testing.
